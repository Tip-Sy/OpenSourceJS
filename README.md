# Open Source JS #

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo contains JS functions that I originally developped for my own needs
* The idea is to share my work whenever I feel it can be useful to others

### Description of the files ###

* [ObjectUtilService](ObjectUtilService.js): Util for complex Object manipulations (such as *Merge* and *Difference* operations)
* [SafariDate](SafariDate.js): Specific implementation of Date constructor for Safari (Version < 7) that doesn't support ISO string format as a parameter

### How do I get set up? ###

* Each file is independent
* Should you need one of them, pick it up
* Test it with your favorite browser (nothing fancy here)

### Contribution guidelines ###

* If you have any suggestion, do not hesitate to contribute! :)
